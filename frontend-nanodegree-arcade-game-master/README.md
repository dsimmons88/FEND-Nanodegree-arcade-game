Frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
===============================

Intro
=================================
This is a project for the Front-End Nanodegree program with Grow with Google. This is the work of Dwaine L Simmons II. 

This is a game about a cute little princess trying to making it to the river. Watch out for those pesky bugs!


How to play
==================================
If you download the zip or clone from github, just open the index.html file. After you loaded the index.html file, the game should load on your screen. After the game load, it should be ready to play. 

Move the princess by using the arrow keys on the keyboard. You beat the game when you get to the river and avoid the bugs. The game will reset if you want to play again.
